- **Company:** Amazon
- **Location:** Hyderabad, Telangana
- **Match Score:** 78/100
- **Why:** Strong technical skills in Python, JavaScript, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and databases align well with the DevOps role's requirements. The Hyderabad location matches a preferred region, though the candidate's 3 years experience is slightly under the 4+ basic qualification.

- **Company:** Adobe
- **Location:** Noida, Uttar Pradesh
- **Match Score:** 68/100
- **Why:** The candidate has strong technical skills in Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS that align well with the DevOps Engineer role.

## 3. Senior Cloud DevOps
- **Company:** Oracle
- **Location:** Bengaluru, Karnataka
- **Match Score:** 80/100
- **Why:** This is a general careers page, not a specific job posting, but the candidate's backend skills (Python, Go, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, databases) and experience are a very good general fit for software engineering roles at a global tech/SaaS company like Oracle. The company's global presence aligns with location preferences.

## 4. Application Consultant-DevOps
- **Company:** IBM India Private Limited
- **Location:** Karnataka
- **Match Score:** 75/100

## 5. Database Automation Engineer - HANA/ Oracle, Devops & Cloud (EX 2-6Y)
- **Company:** SAP
- **Location:** Bengaluru, Karnataka
- **Match Score:** 65/100
- **Why:** The candidate's Python, Go, Node.js, AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes skills align well with the software development and DevOps aspects, and the 3 years of experience fit perfectly. However, there are significant gaps in specific database technologies (HANA, Oracle, MSSQL) and a stated lack of AI/ML/LLM expertise, which are core requirements for this specialized role.

## 6. DevOps and Automation Engineer
- **Company:** NVIDIA
- **Location:** Gurugram, Haryana
- **Match Score:** 55/100
- **Why:** While the location (India) and some technical skills (Python, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS) align, the required experience (5+ years vs. candidate's 3 years) is a significant mismatch. The role's primary focus on DevOps and infrastructure automation also differs from the candidate's backend software development focus.
